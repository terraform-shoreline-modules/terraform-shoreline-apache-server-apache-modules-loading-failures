### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Apache Modules Loading Failures.
---

This incident type refers to situations where Apache web server modules fail to load properly. Apache modules are pieces of code that add specific functionality to the web server, such as caching, security, or compression. When these modules fail to load, it can cause issues with the server's performance, stability, and security. This incident type requires investigation to determine the root cause of the module loading failure and implement a fix to resolve the issue.

### Parameters
```shell
export MODULE_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Check if the module file exists in the Apache modules directory
```shell
ls -l /usr/lib/apache2/modules/ | grep ${MODULE_NAME}
```

### Check if Apache server is running
```shell
systemctl status apache2
```

### Check Apache error logs for any module loading errors
```shell
tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log | grep "unable to load"
```

### List all modules and check if the required module is present
```shell
apachectl -M | grep ${MODULE_NAME}
```

### Check if module file has correct permissions
```shell
ls -l /usr/lib/apache2/modules/${MODULE_NAME}.so
```

### Check if there are any syntax errors in Apache configuration files
```shell
apachectl configtest
```

### Restart Apache server after making any changes to configuration files
```shell
systemctl restart apache2
```

## Repair

### Consider reinstalling or upgrading the Apache server to ensure that the modules are installed correctly.
```shell

#!/bin/bash

# Stop Apache server

sudo systemctl stop apache2

# Remove Apache server package

sudo yum  remove apache2

# Clean residual dependencies

sudo yum autoremove

# Install latest version of Apache server package

sudo yum install apache2

# Start Apache server

sudo systemctl start apache2


```
